[SoftU2F-Win](https://ibigbug.online/softu2f-for-windows) is a software U2F authenticator for Windows. It emulates a hardware U2F HID device and performs cryptographic operations using the DPAPI. This tool works with Google Chrome. Running on other browsers hasn't been tested.

We take the security of this project seriously. Report any security vulnerabilities to open-source@watfaq.com

[![Publish Daemon](https://github.com/SoftU2F/SoftU2F-Win/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SoftU2F/SoftU2F-Win/actions/workflows/release.yml)

## Installation

> **Please use it for production environment on your own risk**

### Download

1. Download the latest driver and daemon release at [Driver Release](https://github.com/SoftU2F/SoftU2F-Win/releases)

1. Run the `driver-install.ps1` in elevated powershell to install the driver. (Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` if needed)


## Usage

The app runs in the background. When a site loaded in a U2F-compatible browser attempts to register or authenticate with the software token, you'll see a notification asking you to accept or reject the request. You can experiment on [Yubico's U2F demo site](https://demo.yubico.com/u2f).

### Command Line Arguments
- *--db-unprotected* - this will save the key pair into a separated sqlite db without the DPAPI protection, this can be useful if you want to back up the db for some reasons. when enabled, the data will be saved in to `db.unprotected.sqlite`. You can find the databases under `$HOME\AppData\Roaming\SoftU2FDaemon`

### Registration

## Uninstalling

### Driver

1. Right Click the Windows logo on you status bar and open Device Manager
2. Under Human Interface Devices, find **SoftU2F Device**, right click and select **Uninstall Device**

### Daemon

1. Exit App
2. Delete the folder where you extracted them.

## Security considerations

This is a port of https://github.com/github/SoftU2F.

Instead of macOS Keychain, we store data using Windows DPAPI, which is designed by Microsoft Windows to store data such as passwords, keys, and connection strings.

For more infomation of DPAPI: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.protecteddata?view=netframework-4.8#remarks

A [note](https://github.com/github/SoftU2F#security-considerations) from Github Team

## Development

### Prerequisites

### Driver

Install:

* Microsoft Visual Studio
* Windows SDK
* Windows Driver Kit (WDK)

Download and tutorials can be found at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/writing-a-very-small-kmdf--driver

And you should be able to compile the driver in Visual Studio.

### Daemon

Daemon is just an NET Core project, no extra requirement other than developing a normal NET Core apps.

## Sponsorships

- Razoreye LTD's fund for the driver signing

## Known app-IDs/facets

Every website using U2F has an app-ID. For example, the app-ID of [Yubico's U2F demo page](https://demo.yubico.com/u2f) is `https://demo.yubico.com`. When the low-level U2F authenticator receives a request to register/authenticate a website, it doesn't receive the friendly app-ID string. Instead, it receives a SHA256 digest of the app-ID. To be able to show a helpful alert message when a website is trying to register/authenticate, a list of app-ID digests is maintained in this repository. You can find the list [here](https://github.com/ibigbug/SoftU2F-Win/blob/master/APDU/KnownFacets.cs). If your company's app-ID is missing from this list, open a pull request to add it.
